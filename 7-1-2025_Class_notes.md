# Class notes for 7/1/2025

- what is data? anything can be data
- database - a platform where we store data
- There are two kinds of database - structured database and unstructured database
- why unstructured database?
    - Faster
    - Easier to scale
    - Not rigid
- why not unstructred database (disadvantages)?
    - need to define some structure later on to be consumed properly by programs
    - not the best with join like queries
- Types of unstructured database
    - graph DB - neo4j
    - columnar DB - cassandra
    - document based DB - mongoDB (The one we will talk about mostly)
    - key value pair - Redis
    - time series data - InfluxDB
- Use of unstructred database 
    - huge amount of read writes of data is there
    - data is distributed
    - sensor data
